# GPT-3 Companion

## What it does

Are you familiar with DeepL's desktop tool for on the fly translations?
The GPT companion tool works in similar ways. You select some text in a source
application and press the configurable hotkey crtl-alt-g. The Companion will
call GPT-3 for you and display the result.

Configure your favorite GPT-3 text processing tasks in profiles, which you can
switch at runtime. For instance, you could have one profile for English,
one for German, one for fun stuff, etc.

With the hotkey it can display a popup menu with the actions at the
mouse position in any application. This feature is configurable.

Once the selected text is copied to the Companion, you can start playing with the GPT parameters
or try different models.

The companion is more convenient than using ChatGPT or OpenAI Playground
where you'll have to copy&paste the text yourself and fiddle with the
same prompts over and over again. You never have to leave the source application.
Just run the companion, put it aside and feed it with text.

The Companion can also stay on top of all windows, which is also configurable.

## OpenAI Chat Models

The companion can use the chat models, however not in a chat-like fashion. The OpenAI API
has a specific endpoint for chat models, which works differently than the other models.
The companion keeps no history of the Q&A with the model, which would be required to make it "chatty".

The chat models must be listed separately in a profile config. See __profile-default.toml__ about how to do it.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.11

## Platforms

Tested and developed under Windows 11

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To allow the Companion read the keyboard and mouse on MacOS, please see the section MacOS under [Platform limitations â€” pynput 1.7.6 documentation](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limitations.html)

## Run

`python3 main.py`

The program must be run in its directory, otherwise the configuration profiles will not be found.

## Configuration

The environment variable OPENAI_KEY must contain your OpenAI API key.

The program is configured through profile files in TOML format. The default profile is **profile-default.toml**.
Custom profiles are collected during startup by reading all files with the .toml extension.

To define a new profile:

* Create a new .toml file in the program's directory
* Use the default profile as a template for the syntax of the properties.
* Mandatory: *settings.name*
* Mandatory: *actions*
